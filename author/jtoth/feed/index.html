<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<div dir="ltr">In recent years the number of regulations, standards, frameworks and the like have increased.  While some are aimed at IT overall, many of them include or even focus on IT Security, which have become more important due to recent event.  And this is likely to increase. Because of this, security professionals are finding themselves expected to follow, adhere to, and/or enforce these standards.  But few have a decent understanding of them.  Starting the Critical Security Controls (formerly known as the SANS Top 20), we’ll take a look at some of the major security frameworks and regulations out there, such as HIPAA, ISO 27001/2, NIST CSF, PCI-DSS, SOX, and others.  The aim is to help security professionals understand the basics of these and get them started on learning more about them.</div>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">When your job is to act as a malicious attacker on a daily basis for the good of helping organizations, you can’t help but wonder “What if I decided to embrace the evil within?” What if one day I woke up evil? Every day as a pentester, I compromise organizations through a variety of ways. If I were to wake up one day and decide to completely throw my ethics out the window, how profitable could I be, and could I avoid getting caught?</p>
<p>In this talk I will walk through a detailed methodology about how I personally would go about exploiting organizations for fun and profit, this time not under the “white hat.” Non-attribution, target acquisition, exploitation, and profitization will be the focal points. Blue teamers will get a peek into the mindset of a dedicated attacker. Red teamers will learn a few new techniques for their attack methodologies.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>CFAA, CAN-SPAM, HIPPA, and CADRA are just a few of the many alphabet-soup acronyms that make up the legal rubric in the United States that govern information security, privacy, and technological issues- information security professionals need to understand the patchwork of laws in the United States (and Florida in particular) to be truly effective in their endeavors.  New state laws appear every day with different standards for what data is considered sensitive and how an organization is dealt with if they disclose protected information. What laws should you be aware of when engaging your organization about risk and data disclosure? This talk will focus on the CFAA, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as CADRA, Florida’s Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act. Adam Losey, an internationally recognized attorney working in Central Florida will discuss information security and privacy law, what it means to information security professionals, and how to approach data privacy laws. The talk will include 20-30 minutes of round table style discussion allowing the audience to ask questions regarding matters of law and data privacy.</p>
<h3><strong>Bio</strong></h3>
<p>Adam Losey is an internationally recognized attorney, author, and educator in the field of technology law. He represents a number of Fortune 100 companies in high-stakes complex litigations across the country involving challenging issues at the intersection of law and technology.

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>A recent study titled, &#8220;Battling the Big Hack&#8221; by IT professional network Spiceworks found that that 80% of organizations experienced an IT security incident in 2015, with 53% of respondents having a concern for ransomware in 2016. But how did we get here? And how can we avoid these growing attacks in the coming year and beyond? In general, all ransomware pretty much works the same in that it tries to extort money from a user, but each variation of it does something slightly different. This presentation will discuss the history of ransomware – from the first known ransomware, which hit the scene back in 1989 (the “AIDS” or “PC Cyborg” Trojan), to Gpcode (RSA encryption schemes), CryptoLocker (Bitcoin transactions), and Cryptowall (targeting Windows), with many others in between. We’ll close out the discussion with 2016 ransomware predictions, as well as how users can mitigate these attacks in the future.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>Over the past few years exploit kits have been widely adopted by criminals looking to infect users with malware.The exploit kit then proceeds to exploit security holes, known as vulnerabilities, in order to infect the user with malware. The entire process can occur completely invisibly, requiring no user action. In my research I try to deconstruct cyber kill chain involving one of the most notorious exploit kits used by cybercriminals – a kit known as Angler exploit kit. This talk will cover the evolution of AEK, it&#8217;s role in raising of ransomware threat, tricks used to send user web traffic to Angler landing pages, and methods to deliver payloads. It will also cover procedures that allowed us at OpenDNS to proactively discover and block landing pages and mitigate the risk of infections delivered by AEK, as well as the preventative measures that end-users and systems administrators can take to mitigate their risks.</p>
