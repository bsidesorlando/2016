<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>CFAA, CAN-SPAM, HIPPA, and CADRA are just a few of the many alphabet-soup acronyms that make up the legal rubric in the United States that govern information security, privacy, and technological issues- information security professionals need to understand the patchwork of laws in the United States (and Florida in particular) to be truly effective in their endeavors.  New state laws appear every day with different standards for what data is considered sensitive and how an organization is dealt with if they disclose protected information. What laws should you be aware of when engaging your organization about risk and data disclosure? This talk will focus on the CFAA, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as CADRA, Florida’s Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act. Adam Losey, an internationally recognized attorney working in Central Florida will discuss information security and privacy law, what it means to information security professionals, and how to approach data privacy laws. The talk will include 20-30 minutes of round table style discussion allowing the audience to ask questions regarding matters of law and data privacy.</p>
<h3><strong>Bio</strong></h3>
<p>Adam Losey is an internationally recognized attorney, author, and educator in the field of technology law. He represents a number of Fortune 100 companies in high-stakes complex litigations across the country involving challenging issues at the intersection of law and technology. In addition to his litigation practice, Mr. Losey routinely advises clients large and small on a variety of sophisticated information security, incident response, privacy, electronic discovery, and data management matters. Inside and out of the courtroom, he efficiently and creatively solves problems for clients in a variety of situations.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>A recent study titled, &#8220;Battling the Big Hack&#8221; by IT professional network Spiceworks found that that 80% of organizations experienced an IT security incident in 2015, with 53% of respondents having a concern for ransomware in 2016. But how did we get here? And how can we avoid these growing attacks in the coming year and beyond? In general, all ransomware pretty much works the same in that it tries to extort money from a user, but each variation of it does something slightly different. This presentation will discuss the history of ransomware – from the first known ransomware, which hit the scene back in 1989 (the “AIDS” or “PC Cyborg” Trojan), to Gpcode (RSA encryption schemes), CryptoLocker (Bitcoin transactions), and Cryptowall (targeting Windows), with many others in between. We’ll close out the discussion with 2016 ransomware predictions, as well as how users can mitigate these attacks in the future.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>The Simulated Physics And Embedded Virtualization Integration (SPAEVI, rhymes with gravy) methodology is designed for industrial control system (ICS) cybersecurity research. The cost of hardware-based industrial control system testbeds often limits entire categories of vulnerability analysis, testing, malware analysis, and etc. Specifically memory corruption vulnerability analysis often risks bricking ICS embedded systems. The SPAEVI methodology is proposed for software-based ICS/SCADA testbeds via embedded system virtualization, where the inputs and outputs are integrated within a physics simulation. The challenges of implementing the methodology are nontrivial, and one must rely on reverse engineering, virtual machine development, exploit development, engineering experience, and embedded system design experience. Foremost, the virtualization of an embedded system will pose unique, non-trivial challenges per target system, due to the wild variation of microprocessor architectures in ICS/SCADA.</p>

In this talk, Mitch Stoltz, Senior Staff Attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, will discuss how to explore and modify hardware and software, and use the knowledge you gather, while avoiding common legal problems. He will also share stories about the latest efforts to preserve the freedom to tinker with everything from phones to cars to medical implants.<br />
