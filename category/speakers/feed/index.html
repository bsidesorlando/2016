<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<div dir="ltr">In recent years the number of regulations, standards, frameworks and the like have increased.  While some are aimed at IT overall, many of them include or even focus on IT Security, which have become more important due to recent event.  And this is likely to increase. Because of this, security professionals are finding themselves expected to follow, adhere to, and/or enforce these standards.  But few have a decent understanding of them.  Starting the Critical Security Controls (formerly known as the SANS Top 20), we’ll take a look at some of the major security frameworks and regulations out there, such as HIPAA, ISO 27001/2, NIST CSF, PCI-DSS, SOX, and others.  The aim is to help security professionals understand the basics of these and get them started on learning more about them.</div>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">When your job is to act as a malicious attacker on a daily basis for the good of helping organizations, you can’t help but wonder “What if I decided to embrace the evil within?” What if one day I woke up evil? Every day as a pentester, I compromise organizations through a variety of ways. If I were to wake up one day and decide to completely throw my ethics out the window, how profitable could I be, and could I avoid getting caught?</p>
<p>In this talk I will walk through a detailed methodology about how I personally would go about exploiting organizations for fun and profit, this time not under the “white hat.” Non-attribution, target acquisition, exploitation, and profitization will be the focal points. Blue teamers will get a peek into the mindset of a dedicated attacker. Red teamers will learn a few new techniques for their attack methodologies.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>CFAA, CAN-SPAM, HIPPA, and CADRA are just a few of the many alphabet-soup acronyms that make up the legal rubric in the United States that govern information security, privacy, and technological issues- information security professionals need to understand the patchwork of laws in the United States (and Florida in particular) to be truly effective in their endeavors.  New state laws appear every day with different standards for what data is considered sensitive and how an organization is dealt with if they disclose protected information. What laws should you be aware of when engaging your organization about risk and data disclosure? This talk will focus on the CFAA, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as CADRA, Florida’s Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act. Adam Losey, an internationally recognized attorney working in Central Florida will discuss information security and privacy law, what it means to information security professionals, and how to approach data privacy laws. The talk will include 20-30 minutes of round table style discussion allowing the audience to ask questions regarding matters of law and data privacy.</p>
<h3><strong>Bio</strong></h3>
<p>Adam Losey is an internationally recognized attorney, author, and educator in the field of technology law. He represents a number of Fortune 100 companies in high-stakes complex litigations across the country involving challenging issues at the intersection of law and technology. In addition to his litigation practice, Mr. Losey routinely advises clients large and small on a variety of sophisticated information security, incident response, privacy, electronic discovery, and data management matters. Inside and out of the courtroom, he efficiently and creatively solves problems for clients in a variety of situations.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>A recent study titled, &#8220;Battling the Big Hack&#8221; by IT professional network Spiceworks found that that 80% of organizations experienced an IT security incident in 2015, with 53% of respondents having a concern for ransomware in 2016. But how did we get here? And how can we avoid these growing attacks in the coming year and beyond? In general, all ransomware pretty much works the same in that it tries to extort money from a user, but each variation of it does something slightly different. This presentation will discuss the history of ransomware – from the first known ransomware, which hit the scene back in 1989 (the “AIDS” or “PC Cyborg” Trojan), to Gpcode (RSA encryption schemes), CryptoLocker (Bitcoin transactions), and Cryptowall (targeting Windows), with many others in between. We’ll close out the discussion with 2016 ransomware predictions, as well as how users can mitigate these attacks in the future.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>Over the past few years exploit kits have been widely adopted by criminals looking to infect users with malware.The exploit kit then proceeds to exploit security holes, known as vulnerabilities, in order to infect the user with malware. The entire process can occur completely invisibly, requiring no user action. In my research I try to deconstruct cyber kill chain involving one of the most notorious exploit kits used by cybercriminals – a kit known as Angler exploit kit. This talk will cover the evolution of AEK, it&#8217;s role in raising of ransomware threat, tricks used to send user web traffic to Angler landing pages, and methods to deliver payloads. It will also cover procedures that allowed us at OpenDNS to proactively discover and block landing pages and mitigate the risk of infections delivered by AEK, as well as the preventative measures that end-users and systems administrators can take to mitigate their risks.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>The Simulated Physics And Embedded Virtualization Integration (SPAEVI, rhymes with gravy) methodology is designed for industrial control system (ICS) cybersecurity research. The cost of hardware-based industrial control system testbeds often limits entire categories of vulnerability analysis, testing, malware analysis, and etc. Specifically memory corruption vulnerability analysis often risks bricking ICS embedded systems. The SPAEVI methodology is proposed for software-based ICS/SCADA testbeds via embedded system virtualization, where the inputs and outputs are integrated within a physics simulation. The challenges of implementing the methodology are nontrivial, and one must rely on reverse engineering, virtual machine development, exploit development, engineering experience, and embedded system design experience. Foremost, the virtualization of an embedded system will pose unique, non-trivial challenges per target system, due to the wild variation of microprocessor architectures in ICS/SCADA.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Almost everything you do on the web is being read and tracked. The web is no longer static HTML. Advanced browser features such as Javascript, cookies, and HTML5 are fantastic for making rich featureful sites, but they can also compromise your privacy. During the course of a typical web browsing session, information about what you read and who you are can be sent to hundreds of third party trackers without your knowledge or consent.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this talk Cooper Quintin, Staff Technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, will discuss the who, what, why and how of web tracking. He will demonstrate two tools: Panopticlick &#8211; EFF&#8217;s website demonstrating browser fingerprinting, and Privacy Badger &#8211; a browser extension to stop online tracking.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
He will also discuss EFF&#8217;s plan to stop non-consensual third party tracking on the web once and for all.

With so many people taking advantage of the cloud, no one really thinks about how the cloud is taking advantage of you. We will be taking an in-depth look at the pros, and mostly cons, of the datacenter clusters that we harmlessly refer to as cloud infrastructure. These pros and cons shift from whitehat to blackhat in an instant depending on the circumstances. From using online backup for your corporate office, to an attacker breaking in, encrypting your cloud data, and ransoming it back to you. While a fortune 500 organization uses the cloud for their storage and email, there is another server physically sitting right next to it propagating exploit kits. We will be presenting real-world examples of how easy it is to hide in the cloud as an attacker, and how impossible it is to hide in the cloud for everyday users. Whether it be saucy selfies, bank or medical records, or even just highly valued data in general; How safe do you actually think it is&#8230;on someone else&#8217;s computer?

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hunting for vulnerabilities in custom protocols can be shrouded in mystery to the novice. While there are many resources on the subject, its hard to find a single source of information that introduces the process from start to finish. This talk aims to introduce the tools and process involved in reversing an unknown protocol, interfacing with it, and ultimately fuzzing it to find vulnerabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The talk will address the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does reversing and fuzzing protocols benefit my security program?</li>
<li>Who should do this kind of work?</li>
<li>What will I need?</li>
</ul>
<p>It will also introduce you to netzob, scapy, wireshark dissectors, nmap NSE, and sulley.

This talk describes how/why system owners need to start taking responsibility for their own security.  The fact that my city has a police department does not mean that I don&#8217;t lock my door or that I am not vigilant about my own property.  Sadly, in IT today, this has gotten lost.  Systems are breached for weeks/months at a time with no one knowing that it is going on.  This year, globally there will be over a million INFOSEC positions that need to be filled.  The fact is, there are not a million IT professionals looking for work, much less INFOSEC.  We can add more eyes and intelligence to the challenge by enlisting system owners to take SOME responsibility for their own security.

As security teams have evolved, system owners themselves have all but absolved themselves of taking any responsibility for their own security.  He wants to change that!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In recent years the number of regulations, standards, frameworks and the like have increased.  While some are aimed at IT overall, in light of recent events many of them have included or even focused on IT Security.  And this is likely to increase. Because of this, security professionals are finding themselves expected to follow, adhere to, and/or enforce these standards.  But few have a decent understanding of them.  Using as our basis the Critical Security Controls (formerly known as the SANS Top 20), we’ll take a look at some of the major security frameworks and regulations out there, such as HIPAA, ISO 27001/2, NIST CSF, PCI-DSS, SOX, and others.  The aim is to help security professionals understand the common security issues these various models strive to address.

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In digital forensics, sometimes you get a case where the standard tools do not provide the information you need. Whether you need metadata and files from an obsolete file system or you need to extract the data from unsupported file types, writing digital forensics tools in Python gives you abilities beyond those of widely used tools. In this session, learn about some of the Python toolkits and techniques that can help you solve those tough, unexpected digital forensics problems. A case study will be presented to show how Python was used to extract metadata and files from the legacy Macintosh File System (MFS).</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Internet of Things has become the biggest buzzword to come out from 2015. But there are some serious efforts by big tech companies like IBM to create next generation technologies that talk to each other using the same language. What kind of security policies will we be able to design for a new type of networking? How do our traditional approaches work and where can we draw new inspiration from?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This talk focuses on some recent attacks on IoT technologies and what we have learned from them. More interestingly, what kind of attacks do the experts speculate will happen when IoT is more prevalent. What will be the implications of DoS when everything is online? A cautionary tale, but it almost feels like we&#8217;re living in the best of the times.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This talk will focus on ways a legal, ethical, and authorized penetration tester can prepare themselves to inspire trust in those protecting their target allowing them to gain access to protected areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This talk will look at the physical signs that someone doesn’t belong in an area and how to create a persona that “belongs”. During the talk we will compare different outfits and uniforms used by workers who would be expected to be in controlled areas. The talk will also look at paralanguage and body language that can be used to put people at ease.</p>
<p>The talk will cover:</p>
<p>Why physical access controls are critical<br />
Tales of “Physical Access Gone Wrong”<br />
Uniforms, attire, and details that give away an imposter<br />
Paralanguage – What to say to put people at ease<br />
Body language – What to do to put people at ease<br />
“The Getaway” – How to get out gracefully<br />
Preventing Interlopers – What can you do to stop attackers using these techniques</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of the talk the audience should be able to leverage these techniques to test their own security program, bolster their approved penetration testing program, and develop new controls to prevent physical attackers.</p>
